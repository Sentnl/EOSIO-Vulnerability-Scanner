# ðŸª² EOSIO Vulnerability Scanner using AI

This is a tool that connects to the OpenAI API and scans all c++ files in your GitHub repository for EOSIO Smart contract vulnerabilities.
The current workflow will run after each push request.


## Follow these steps to setup. 

###  Create a GitHub Action:

1. First, create a new GitHub Action in your repository. You can do this by adding a .github/workflows/main.yml file to your repository using the contents found in `example/main.yml`
2. Ensure you replace the engine paramater with your desired OpenAI engine.

See here for a list of engines [OpenAI models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview) 


### Set up an OpenAI API key:

1. Go to the main page of their GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "Settings" tab.
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables."
4. Click on the Action button.
5. Click on New repository secret
5. Enter OPENAI_API_KEY as the name and provide their own OpenAI API key as the value.
6. Click on "Add secret."

### Now the next time you commit code, the action will run and scan your code for vulnerabilities.
